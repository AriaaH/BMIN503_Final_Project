# BMIN503/EPID600 Final Project

The project aims to design protein circuits that can sense clusters of diseased proteins to cause targeted cell death. The data analyzed here are collected based on cell apoptosis after cells being transfected with different apoplectic constructs at various time points. The goal of this project is to determine the optimal protein circuit design to engineer cell death in cancerous cells.

Source data: expression over time.csv & death expression.csv

Variables:
Time: time point when the cells were imaged t = 0/2/6/8/12 hrs

Constructs: split TEV-PC3 TEV trunc TEV trunc TEVcsQ TEV trunc TEVcsL TEV trunc TEVcsM Cry2-GFP

Fluorescent Channels: mCherry mCherry+DAPI mCherry+FITC mCherry+FITC+DAPI

Treatments: base/stimulated (stimulated with FITC)

Experiment setup: -Cells stimulated with FITC are hypothesized to express the transfected constructs which would lead to cell apoptosis. -mCherry - apoptosis circuit is activated -DAPI: cell nuclei -FITC: cry2 - to stimulate the death circuit to start
