# BMIN503/EPID600 Final Project\

# Project setup
Source data: Split TEV Cry2.csv
Variables: 
- Time: time point when the cells were imaged 
  t = 0/2/6/8/12 hrs 

- Plasmid: 
  split TEV-PC3
  TEV trunc
  TEV trunc TEVcsQ
  TEV trunc TEVcsL
  TEV trunc TEVcsM
  Cry2-GFP
  
- Fluorescent Channels: 
  mCherry
  mCherry+DAPI
  mCherry+FITC
  mCherry+FITC+DAPI
  
- Treatments: 
  base 
  stimulated (stimulated with FITC)
  
- Experiment setup: 
  Cells stimulated with FITC are hypothesized to express the transfected constructs which would lead to cell apoptosis. 
  mCherry - apoptosis circuit is activated 
  DAPI: cell nuclei
  FITC: cry2 - to stimulate the death circuit to start
